# Sample for the Amplify GraphQL API L3 CDK construct

This is a sample repository showcasing the Amplify GraphQL API L3 CDK construct in action. It allows you to leverage all the benefits of the Amplify GraphQL directives (`@model`, `@auth`, etc.) via CDK. 

## Key features
- üîó **GraphQL APIs and connected DynamoDB tables with a single schema**
  - Use the `@model` directive from Amplify to generate both an AppSync API with CRUDL operations and their connected DynamoDB sources. A five line GraphQL schema in Amplify would‚Äôve taken hundreds of lines of code and multiple files to write previously.
- ü§Ø **Use all Amplify GraphQL directives such as `@auth`**
  - Instead of hand-authoring hundreds of lines of JS/VTL resolver code to handle your app‚Äôs authorization needs, you can now leverage Amplify‚Äôs `@auth` directive to enforce owner-based authorization, group-authorization with just a single line of code. Don‚Äôt worry, you can still write JS/VTL resolver code you if you‚Äôd like.
  - This is great for customers that want the ergonomics of Amplify‚Äôs GraphQL capabilities but don‚Äôt want to setup the Amplify CLI or use CDK tooling already.
- üöÄ **Escape hatches built-in**
  - access/modify all the generated resources as L2 constructs directly from within CDK. No separate build step required.
  - The construct returns an object that contains a resources key. In which you‚Äôll find the L1 and L2 constructs that it generates for resources such as AppSync API, DynamoDB tables, etc.
- üßë‚Äçüíª **Works seamlessly with the rest of the CDK tooling**
  - In our sample code below, you‚Äôll see how easy it is to combine L2 Lambda Function CDK constructs with the Amplify GraphQL L3 constructs.
  - Yes. It works with CDK pipelines.

## What's deployed as part of this demo?

1. A `Blog` DynamoDB table with authorization rules permitting anyone with an API Key to Create/Read/Update/Delete the items to the table.
2. A `echo` query that returns whatever string is sent to it using a Lambda function handler.
3. A `sendEmail` mutation that publishes an SNS event with an email subscription using **JavaScript resolvers**.

## Quick tour of `lib/backend-stack.ts`

Go to `lib/backend-stack.ts` to start exploring the code base:
- `lib/backend-stack.ts` includes the AmplifyGraphQlApi CDK construct. You can pass in any schema that works with the Amplify CLI today.
- `addSNSTopicHandler()` showcases how to use the escape hatch to connect the generated L2 construct with additional resources within your AWS account such as an SNS topic. **IMPORTANT: make sure to enter your email into the ENTER_YOUR_EMAIL_HERE to receive the SNS notifications**

## Useful commands
* `cdk watch --hotswap-fallback` watches and deploy ongoing file changes
* `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
